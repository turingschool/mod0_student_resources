favorite resources thusfar:

codecademy looks like it
will be promising as a supplement

the lessons are very helpful to review

the slack is incredibly helpful for getting questions answered

googling problems and clicking on reddit or quora links where people have worked through those things before has helped me a couple of times

github itself has been amazing for troubleshooting issues, the suggestions are very helpful

the terminal sometimes suggests alternatives to commands that aren't working, that's been helpful too
