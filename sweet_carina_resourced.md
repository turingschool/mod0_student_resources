The best recourse so far for me is referencing back to the Sessions plans and rereading everything. Going back through the examples and getting the extra practice.
Being able to Google and trouble shoot any issue that I come across.
I have been able to also follow or participate in Slack conversations. It will sometime help be before I get to a hurdle or get help once I am there.
