Favorite Resources
 * KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS!!!
 * Calendar and Notebook with details and color use.
 * Random websites and links to resources that have been either provided or
 were shared by cohort-mates. They are little rabbit holes on learning more...
 * The commit message article was interesting in the way it can help you and
 your collaborators to keep track of your changes easier. I'm trying to follow
 the rules as best I can early.
