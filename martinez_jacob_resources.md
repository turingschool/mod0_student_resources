I've been really into customizing my Terminal, mainly using resources that can
be found using Github. I also really like consistent colors across my applications,
so I use a theme called Dracula that can be applied to many code editors.

Oh-my-zsh for customizing zsh further:

The reference guide I used to customize my ~/.zhsrc and theme file:

Syntax highlighting plugin you can use with ZSH(must have):

And finally, my theme of choice, Dracula:
