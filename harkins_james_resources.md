The most useful resources that I have used so far in Mod 0 and in the Mod 1
Pre-work have been:

  1. Stack Overflow: I have already found myself here a few times during my
     Google journeys. There is a ton of information here and the voting
     system helps to separate the useful from the distracting.
  2. Google in general: I have been able to get further than I'd initially
     anticipated in the Mod 1 Prework. Much of my success in doing so is
     thanks to working my way through obstacles using Google to find
     answers.
  3. The Markdown cheat sheet: Proper formatting makes for more legible
     material, so this has been extremely useful in creating .md files
     that I would feel comfortable submitting to a boss.
