1. I was referred to a site by another student called replit.com that allows you to run your code in an emulator. It's compatible with Ruby, Python, and Javascript. It's been super useful for me to experiment with some of the things I'm learning about JavaScript.
2. I subscribed to a really helpful and welcoming community on Reddit called [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/). There's a lot of really helpful information on there, [here's one of my favorite posts that contains a free practice tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8gqddo/i_made_this_free_tool_for_learning_programming/) for all sorts of programming languages.
3. The "JavaScript and JQuery" recommended textbook has also proved to be incredibly useful in learning the concepts being introduced in the Mod 1 pre-work.
