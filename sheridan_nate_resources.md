Turing has taught me one very valuable thing so far. Google is everyones best friend. 90% of the time someone somewhere has had the exact same error or question that I have had and Google has been able to help me find those questions, errors and instructions to fix them. Beyond Google, things like help.github.com have also been a big help. Still figuring out slack to utilize it to it's full potential, but I have already answered 2 of my concerns by looking through older notes made using Slack. I know with some practice it will be very useful when we are all working on the same thing. Last but not least, Youtube is always great. Seeing the workflow of someone else doing what I need to do in video form has been very useful in the past, and I assume will be very useful in the future here at Turing.
