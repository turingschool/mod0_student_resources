# My resources

1. [Use The Keyboard](https://usethekeyboard.com): I just discovered this one today and it looks awesome. Lots of shortcut reference sheets including Slack, Chrome, GitHub, Spotify, Twitter, YouTube, you name it.
2. [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) I really like Chris Pine's book on basic Ruby. It makes the concepts really simple to understand and isn't dry.
3. [Ruby-Doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org) On the dryer end, I look at this a lot. It's hard to read, but it also has everything.
4. I find youtube videos helpful for lots of things. Jesus Castello operates a site called [RubyGuides](https://www.rubyguides.com) He has some paid and free resources there including his book, but he also has a youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCRO4CMJQgoabub5SzJQug) that I've found helpful for understanding some concepts.
5. [Atom keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts) I found this GitHub repo a few days ago and thought it was helpful.[This one](http://www.atomtexteditor.com) seems pretty good too.
