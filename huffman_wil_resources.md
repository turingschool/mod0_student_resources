Oh wow, what a question.

Google has been a favorite resource so far, Stack Overflow, finding cheatsheets online, asking quick questions from a family member who happens to be a Turing graduate as well as the Slack board.

Also, I have acquired two more resources: two Turing graduates that are willing to help me with questions. I understand that this particular resource is not available to everyone, but outside technical help can be extremely helpful.
