  Trustworthy resource for all coding questions

  I really struggled with logical operators, this doc helped me understand them. Generally I like the information provided on this site.
* [How to Use Git and Git Workflows](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practical-git-and-git-workflows/#git-workflows-for-collaboration)

  I like this guide. It's thorough and easy for me to navigate.
* [git docs](https://git-scm.com/doc) & [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en)

  I try read the docs. I'm still learning to digest technical writing.
