Great Git command cheat sheet, I think it'll be useful to implement the default text editor function to avoid having to type "atom" all the time in the future.

It might also help with efficiency if I made shortcuts or alias for git commands --this is probably not a great ideal until I'm very familiar with Git...and it sounds like that might take a while? :)
