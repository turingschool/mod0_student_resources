My new favorite resource is Google.
My second favorite resource is fellow classmates who know more things than I do.
Slack has become really easy to use, and sort of a comforting support.
My instructors are also a great resource.
I love learning how all the programs interact together, seeing them interact helps me understand their purpose and what they do.
