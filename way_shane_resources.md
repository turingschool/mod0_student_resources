Favorite Resources List

1) Udemy - Purchased javascript, css, & html self-guided courses
      - Only been working on js material at the moment.

2) Notes app - I have been creating  parent + child note folders that accompany each lesson. I use these for the best links and keep adding to the folders as new material arises. Has been helping me trouble shoot quickly.

3) The markdown cheat sheet link provided for HW 2 is an extremely helpful link.
