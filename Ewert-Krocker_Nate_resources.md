##TWINE

Actually, the most useful resource I've had in my "journey as a software developer," if we can call it that at this point,
has been messing about in <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>, the engine for interactive fiction.

At its most basic, Twine can operate like an HTML version of a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book, but it also has the capability
to handle variables, if/else statements, and other building block concepts of code. Messing around with these, and trying to
figure out how to make my Twine stories "more like a real game," helped me to get the basic concepts of coding down.

Not that any of us have any extra time on our hands, but it's worth experimenting with, especially if you like interactive
fiction!

(If you have kids and want to introduce them to Twine, I've had a great time introducing it to my students
using this book: <a href="https://nostarch.com/twinegames">Make Your Own Twine Games!</a>)
