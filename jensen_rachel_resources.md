### Favorite IRL Resources
+ Building a master notebook - I write my class notes in a basic notebook and I don't worry how messy they are or how important what I'm capturing is. Then, I take a little time to copy the important things more neatly into a master notebook with a table of contents.
+ Frustration/Anxiety management - As a perfectionist, I can get into some grim mental places when my efforts to learn or create get frustrated. Identifying the mental/physical early warning signs and taking immediate action to redirect is critical. Example: my early warning sign are thoughts like "this should be easy" or "everyone else gets this" and physical signs like deep breathing/sighing or feeling hot. My redirect is to immediately get up and do something that stimulates a sensory response in my brain like standing outside in the sunshine, splashing cold water on my face, or making a fragrant cup of coffee or tea. Then, I can return to work thinking more clearly.
