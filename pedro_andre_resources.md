1. Slack and all the different channels inside. I'm a big fan of the luncheons and when they bring back previous students to talk about their success
2. The mod0 sessions. Anytime I need to look back at something (like how to hyperlink a phrase), I go to these before I venture into the internet.
3. Fellow students. Everyone has been super friendly and eager to help.
