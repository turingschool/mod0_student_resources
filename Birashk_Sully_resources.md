Honestly I think one of my favorite resources is going to have to be Git. I think that its really cool that you can work on something anywhere, upload it, go to another computer and get back to working on it!! I think that it shows how free you can be when working in the future!

Another Great resources i've highly appreciated would be my uncle, he helps me challenge myself and helps me understand a certain thing in a better way. He has been a great help and i'm excited to graduate turing like he did!
