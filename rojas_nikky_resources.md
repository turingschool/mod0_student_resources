Some resources I found helpful were google, youtube, git hub forums.
Google is useful for quick searches
Youtube in very useful to visually see how something is done. Especially if you struggle understanding certain concepts
When getting error codes or issues with GitHsub/slack more than likely there are forums from those websites that have the answers.
