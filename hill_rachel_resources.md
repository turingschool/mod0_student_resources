1. GOOGLE!
2. Turing's lessons on the Mod0 websites have been extremely helpful that I often find myself referring back to.
3. Javascript.info has been really helpful in explaining the fundamentals of this language and providing awesome examples.
4. Javascript and jquery PDF book is another resource I have found to lean on quite a bit.
