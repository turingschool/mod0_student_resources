# Let's talk resources:

1.  Google Calendar. I never really used it before, or even really calendared. I had the benefit of a set schedule, and find routine quickly. Using the calendar, and making sure I check it daily, has kept me up to speed on classes and homework.
2.  Slack! It's been very interesting getting used to the features.
3.  My notes! Drawing diagrams of how code will run and the git workflow helps me understand the process.
4.  apidock.com has helped me find definitions for code I encounter during exercises that I don't understand.
5.  Learn Ruby the Hard Way exercises have really helped me get a feel for coding. I like the extra study drills and questions at the bottom of lessons.
