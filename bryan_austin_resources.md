List of favorite resources include
1. Finding 1 or 2 peers early on to help out and better manage time if you've realized you're spending too much time on a project.
2. I like the template change within the terminal as far as the color setup
3. I've also found some good websites beyond the couple main ones I already knew as well as some decent videos on YouTube that were short but easy enough to follow.
4. And I have to at least verbally say that I really appreciate the understanding on some people's part. Pandemic, new to coding aside, I'm making many more adjustments all at once and this type of change especially is never easy. But hanging on for the ride can make it rewarding.  So thank you for giving me the cushion to catch up.  I didnt want to spend my time thinking about if I wanted to even be in Turing so I just did the work and feel better as a result. Thanks.
