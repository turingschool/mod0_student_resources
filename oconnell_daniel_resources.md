1. I learn best by watching someone else do something, then immediately trying to recreate it, so for bigger concepts I love me a youtube video.
2. https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links has been essential in class so far
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNdRuolwQDE&list=PLEZbTHgLUz1aEMfH3gIwhyp6bSvnuB1p2&index=1&t=310s This video walked me through the first "coding" I ever did. I was trying to build a competitive analysis document for a crypto-currency company I worked for. This was the first time I thought "oh, wait, this is kind of cool"
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou_floKQqd8&list=PLEZbTHgLUz1bTRRil_EHxbxgt7-hWWA6G This video is what I'm working with right now in my free time. I'm hoping to build a twitter-bot before Mod1 starts. I've got a bunch of fun projects I want to build after Turing, but one idea I'm hoping to squeeze in before then. This video is my current best lead on how to do so.
5. Any page of the "Javascript and Jquery PDF" that has labelled drawings of the pieces of code we'll be using. I have a hard time with the breakdown of the code into smaller parts, I'm better at just figuring out intuitively how to use them via experimentation. The PDF is helpful with the more "school-y" aspects of Turing so far.
