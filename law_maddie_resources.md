## Maddie's favorite Coding/Turing resources (so far)

1. The Turing lesson plans for Mod0 (great to full read through for additional practice activities)
2. Codecademy (for some supplemental foundations & practice on Javascript)
3. Code Wars (has been super fun for some coding challenges)
4. MDN Web Docs
5. The GitHub Guides site has been good supplemental material for learning the Github workflow
