## Favorite Resources

1. Youtube has been a huge resource for me in helping me grasp concepts like Git.
The videos I've come across seem to simplify the language and just have helped to
make it not seem so abstract. [One example here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)

2. Although I haven't utilized it, the couple of Codecademy courses Turing has linked
are resources I'm super excited to use to get more practice with Git and JavaScript
before Mod 1 starts to keep my newly acquired skill sharp while I wait for classes
to begin!

3. Google has obviously been key in searching for any extra pointers in code that
I haven't been able to find in our courses.

4. Slack has been the most beneficial resource for me because I've not only gotten
comfortable asking questions (even if they seem stupid!) but I've also managed
to help a couple of my classmates out which has boosted my confidence in what I'm doing!
It's also just been a great place to reach out if I'm getting hung up on something
small where a professor can easily point out my mistake instead of me spending
a frustrated, discouraging hour trying to figure out where I went wrong.
