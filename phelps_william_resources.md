Apps I've Implemented into my Workflow:
-Evernote (hand written notes re-written here)
-Be Focused (Pom timer)
-Todoist (awesome to do list app)
Rectangle (better and infinitely cheaper then magnet)
1Password7 (minds well not use *password* for every password)

Apps to Implement:
-Streaks (helps build habbits)
-Blue Light blocker?
