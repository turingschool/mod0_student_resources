Apps I've Implemented into my Workflow:\
-Evernote (my hand written notes are then re-written here)\
-Be Focused (Pom timer)\
-Todoist (awesome to do list app)\
-Rectangle (better and infinitely cheaper then magnet)\
-1Password7 (I figured I minds well not use *password* for *every* password)

Apps to Implement:\
-Streaks (might help build positive habits)\
-Blue Light Blocker? (need to research this, would prevent eye fatigue)
