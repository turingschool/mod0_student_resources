1. My number 1 resource so far has been YouTube actually. I am a visual learner so when I have been confused about a concept and am having trouble grasping it by working through it on my own, I look up a related YouTube video that explains it with visuals in a very beginner friendly way
2. Also google obviously is a huge resource
3. Learn Ruby the Hard Way is actually a really great and helpful resource, I have been doing some of these beyond just what is assigned because it fits my learning style well.
4. Haven't used these yet but some sites recommended on Reddit for Ruby practice: https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby , https://rubymonk.com/
