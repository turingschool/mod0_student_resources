## Mod0 Student Resources

1. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  - Hands down the **BEST** resource I've found so far. It has answers to pretty much anything and everything. When searching for solutions to coding problems that I've had on CodePen it feels like W3 offers the least "subjective" answers to problems I've run into. Not sure if that's the right word for it, but a lot of answers on Stack Overflow and other sites seem like people argue over A LOT of solutions.

2. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  - I like to think of this as the Reddit of programmings. While it's a very good resource for finding solutions to your problems, it still is a forum and inherently has the same issues as any forums do. People have opinions and everyone's opinions are different, BUT someone has asked that same question you have before and you'll more than likely find many different ways to fix your problem.

3. [Code Pen](https://codepen.io)
  - This site is SO FUN. I found it a little bit before the Try Coding workshop that Turing offers (I was enrolled before the Try Coding workshop) and even now that Mod0 has started I still like to play in it to test things out. My friends who work in the industry that are Senior Software Engineers had never heard of it and immediately said they wished they had that as a resource for when they were in college getting their CS degree. They warned that the real world will never look like "that" (meaning: having all three FEE languages and the website updating after every word you type), but it's a phenomenal tool for tinkering and grasping the basics.

4. [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon)
  - This site is also a BLAST. Definitely aimed as a resource for teachers that are instructing the basics to elementary school student (where were programming classes when I was 8 years old?!), but it is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Basically you learn HTML, python, or various languages offered through a game that is designed as you programming the game itself. From my little understanding, it feels pretty dang in depth. It's also a bit of an RPG style game, so as you advance through the levels you can upgrade your armor and get new gear that provides you access to different functions in coding. :)

5. [Slack Keyboard Shortcuts](https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts)
  - Self explanatory. Long list of everything you need to know for keyboard shortcuts in Slack!

6. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
  - Udemy is AWESOME! It is basically an online university or database where people all around the world who are experts in their field can upload HOURS and HOURS of curriculum so others can learn from them! The best part of the site is you can basically get a college education for dirt cheap. Hundreds of hours worth of material for sometimes only $5.00-$25!

7. [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/?utm_source=pepperjam&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term=229159&clickId=3692760751&pj_creativeid=2-438167&pj_publisherid=229159)
  - Similar to Udemy, Code Academy is another fantastic site with courses on everything from web development, to machine learning, cybersecurity, and even math! I have not personally used it yet, but I've heard great things!
