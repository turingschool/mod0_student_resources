1. Lola Dolinisky - seeing my best friend burnt out as an SPL and move to a career in software development has been so inspiring. She is now my mentor and continuously reminds me that I'm doing the right thing.
2. Nicole - my beautiful partner who supported me through the up and downs of a dead-end job and encouraged me to quit. She reminded me that plenty of people have multiple careers in their lifetime and that Turing is a brand new beginning.
3. Slack - I love the collaboration and real-time feedback when needed
