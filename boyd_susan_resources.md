Resources that have helped me!
1. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
   - This helped me decide if coding was a direction I wanted to go in
   - It helped me again when deciding whether I wanted to front end or back end
2. [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/)
   - When researching different bootcamps I used this site a lot
   - I also used to read about Turing and had actually already read the GitHub article from the homework when researching Turing
