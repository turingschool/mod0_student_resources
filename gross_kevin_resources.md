1. Stack Overflow has definitely been has a huge help in terms of finding out solutions and help related to specific lines of code from other devs.
2. MDN Web Docs has also been good to reference the processes and exact lines of code for certain scripts. It also has tutorials to help you with learning different coding languages.
3. Exercism seems like it will be a good practice and learning tool in the future. I have not had the chance to try out many features on it yet but it seems very helpful.
Although maybe not the most reliable source at times, the r/webdev subreddit is packed full of interesting questions and interesting things regarding web development.
