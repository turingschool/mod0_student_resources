any of the programs/websites "help pages"
I was using udemy to learn basic JavaScript, but I haven't looked at that site in a while
mostly just showing up for class and practicing everyday
I have used friends that have either gone through a coding program, or are going to go through a program
my immediate community has been very supportive and helpful in a different way, but I just wanted to give them a shoutout as well
