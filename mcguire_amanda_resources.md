## My Favorite Resources

Here is a list of some of the resources I use most so far:

+ [Google](https://www.google.com/) :clap:
+ [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) I have found I will head to a stackoverflow article after searching on Google.
+ [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) I am always looking back at this sheet because I am not very good with Markdown and am trying to get better.
