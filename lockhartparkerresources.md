* The [Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) is one of my favorite resources so far. Its actually really easy to read and has helped me understand stuff much better!  
* [Ops School Curriculum](https://www.opsschool.org/) is ton of free information on what feels like everything about computers. Really good lessons and content.  
* Of course, free coding tutorial sites like [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog) have helped me get in some practice and solidify fundamentals.  
* I've also found that my experience doing electrical and electronic work has helped my understanding of coding a lot too. One of my favorite websites with a ton of good lessons is [AllAboutCircuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/).
