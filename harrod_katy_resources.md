I read a mind for numbers before I got to Turing, it has some amazing study tips.

I've also found myself on the stackoverflow site many times when googling issues I'm running into!!

I really can't stress enough the importance of therapy. Taking care of my brain is essential to putting new stuff in it.

I was also listening to the base.cs podcast shortly before I got here just to get my head used to learning new concepts again.
