Favorite Resources so far:
Github' internal documentation, and guides in their 'Help Section'
git-scm.com (has come up in several google searches and has provided help with commands and tips, and setup)
stackoverflow.com (is great to see how people approach problems with similar questions and how people fill in potential answers from there)
Turing Slack Channel - seeing the tips and tricks that other students in Mod 0, as well as the main 2108 channel has been extremely helpful for some abstract tips and tricks.
