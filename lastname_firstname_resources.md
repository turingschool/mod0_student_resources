# List of favorite resources so far

1. Google : even tho its a obvious one this resource is very helpful
if you know how to do your proper research to get to your solution that you are
looking for.

2. Youtube : I tend to consider myself as a more visual leaner I like to see
visually how a solution that I am looking for can be fixed. Youtube is something
I tend to search my questions in and it has been helpful as well.

3. Slack : This resource is very helpful because you can communicate with your
co-workers about a problem you are going thru and see if anybody else is going
thru the same situation and if someone found the solution to the problem and
can give you some help to solve your problem.
