I have used many resources like the obvious ones like google, youtube, and stackoverflow. But one website that I LOVE using is reddit!!! It had such a huge community and I have found answers on there so many times. Another one is Discord! When I was going through freecodecamp's curriculum on JS, HTML and CSS I was making little projects and websites  and got reviews and advice from them. They also have job postings on the server as well!
