I have found that working through the resources Turing provided has been extremely beneficial and much more focused study than simply Googling how to do things.

Turing has made it much easier than it would be if I were trying to learn this on my own because I know the instruction, resources and links to sites are what I really need to know, versus me trying to figure out what is relevant on my own.
